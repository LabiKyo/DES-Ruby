DES Ruby Implementation
=======================

What's This?
------------

Just as the name implies, this is a DES Ruby Implementation. It is a homework assignment of BUAA Software Engineering's information security course. [**Wang Haiquan**](mailto:whq@buaa.edu.cn) is the lecturer of this course.

I'm asked to implement DES using C or Java, but I haven't been coding C/Java for a long time, and more familiar with scripting languages like Python, CoffeeScript/JavaScript, Ruby. So I decided to implement DES in Ruby first as a good starting point, then rewrite it using C or Java.

Why You Create This Repository?
-------------------------------

I know there are trousands of implementation for DES and mine might be the worst, I just do it in order to prove that I implement this algorithm myself. It's also a practice for sharing and open-source coding. Also, I want to have some code to show my future employer and friends.
